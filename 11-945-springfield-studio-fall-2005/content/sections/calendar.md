As a practicum course, the class developed over the course of the semester in response to student analysis and client feedback. The following schedule captures the original scaffolding on which the course was built, and includes all of the elements that students had an opportunity to pursue over the course of the semester. As studnets learned more about the North End community, they chose to emphasize some of the economic development techniques over others, and they used some of the lecture sessions as work time, consulting with faculty when they had specific questions about the models presented at the beginning of the semester. Most of the students also scheduled site visits on a more regular basis than the once-a-month required trips.

This course is broken down into regularly numbered sessions and 4 scheduled field trips (FT), designated FT1, FT2, FT3, FT4.
